# Love

This is a topic that could be summed up in 1 verse but have so much depth to it. I believe every true Christian at one point in their walk will realize the great depth of Gods love. Simply looking at the iconic verse John 3:16 Gods love is revealed to us. That he loved us so much to actually give his life for us.

> “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. - John 3:16 ESV

In essence this is the Gospel. The sacrificial Love of Christ paid the price of sin that we may have eternal life. It's breathtaking when you realized the God of the universe humbled himself, came down to earth, and died for your sins! In romans 5:8 I believe it captures this very well.

> “But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” - Romans 5:8 ESV

## God is Love

With understanding this everything falls into sense when we see the verses “God is Love”. This phrase to some people may not make any sense but when we understand the love of God we see that the ultimate example of love was shown in the cross. Making the verse “God is love” very true.

## Love is God

This is the very corrupt belief of the world. “Love is God” is what many people worship nowadays. The world absouluty worships love but their “love” is not real love. I like to take an example of a gardener and a women. You can say that both individuals love flowers but when you look at their “Love” it is very different. Normal women will go to a flower field and pick flowers for herself and that's their form of love. A gardener on the other hand will have flowers and they will water and raise the flowers to be as health and beautiful as possible. These are 2 definitions of love. One that thinks of themself and another that is selfless and does for others.
